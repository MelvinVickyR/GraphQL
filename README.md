# GraphQL

Build a sample application using GraphQL

**What is GraphQL**

- GraphQL is a query language for APIs. It was designed to be a more efficient and flexible alternative to RESTful APIs.
- GraphQL allows clients to specify exactly what data they need, and it returns only that data, making it more efficient and faster than traditional RESTful APIs. It also allows for real-time data updates, which is not possible with traditional RESTful APIs. GraphQL is often used in modern web and mobile applications that require real-time data updates and flexible data retrieval.
